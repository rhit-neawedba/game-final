# Rosie's Gambit

Authors: Anthony D., Benjamin N., Michael N., Skye W.

## Gameplay
The robotics team's latest project has gone rogue, and it falls to you to save Rose-Hulman! Your task is to navigate the BIC and collect circuit boards that 
contain code that could help stop the robots. Your goal is to gather as many of these circuit boards as possible. But beware, these robots do NOT like humans 
(or elephants) intruding on their property...
